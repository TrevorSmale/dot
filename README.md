# Config Files

## I use Alacritty + Neovim + Tmux for Terminal/CLI based work

There is a folder for each CLI with Associated Readme but may simplify this in the near future.
For my Neovim config I am still using Vim Script but plan on re writing in LUA.

## CLI Application Descriptions

Alacritty - Is an Open Source cross platform terminal.
Neovim - Is a mouseless text editing instrument with many speed focused commands.
TMUX - Is a terminal multiplexor that both allows for terminal window management and session management.
